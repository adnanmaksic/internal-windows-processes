### Introduction - Windows Internal Processes
> Windows internal proccesses are as the name suggests, and are fundamental to how the operating system runs executables, store information, and manage a variety of resources.

> I "discovered" these through detecting cheats for certain games like Grand Theft Auto 5, Minecraft, Among Us, and a variety of other games. Of course, I quote, discovered, because this has been done by others as well. If you see any issues, or would like to add additional information, feel free create an post in the "Issues" tab.

> These contain my reports of how each process stores different information that can be leveraged for good.

> Any open source tool that offers some form of system monitoring, process management, and string searching is very beneficial to manually doing these. Of course, the one I use is System Informer, formerly Process Hacker; however, if you prefer Sysinternals by Microsoft or other tools, you can use the following:

> Process Monitor, Process Explorer, AutoRuns, x64dbg, Cheat Engine, or create a script that scans for strings in a process.

### Navigating the Directory
