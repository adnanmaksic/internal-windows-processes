## Introduction - Windows Internal Processes
	Hello, welcome to my repository of the explanation of internal Windows processes. I "discovered"
	these through detecting cheats for certain games like Grand Theft Auto 5, Minecraft, Among Us, and
	a variety of other games. Of course, I quote, discovered, because this has been done by others as well.

	These contain my reports of how each process stores different information that can be leveraged for good.

    Any open source tool that offers some form of system monitoring, process management, and string searching
	is very beneficial to manually doing these. Of course, the one I use is System Informer, formerly Process Hacker;
	however, if you prefer Sysinternals by Microsoft or other tools, you can use the following:

	Process Monitor, Process Explorer, AutoRuns, x64dbg, Cheat Engine, or create a script that 
	scans for strings in a process.

## Navigating the Directory
	Each file contains one of the following:
	- An explanation of the internal process and a report of how to detect
	- Subdirectory of an internal process with a separate explanation of each.
