### MsMpEng.exe
> Short for Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.

### Explanation
> MsMpEng.exe resides as a core process within Windows Defender, the pre-installed antimalware on all Windows systems. This process actively scans files, memory, and network activity.

> More likely then not, unless disabled, or using another antimalware software: if a person is going to run an executable, whether a cheat for a game, or malware, MsMpEng.exe will scan the file.

> Some cheat developers will sign or publish their executable, some cheat or malware developers will obfuscate their code. Either or, MsMpEng.exe is likely to have traces of the signature or flag of the executable that was ran on the system.
